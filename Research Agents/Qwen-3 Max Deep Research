# A Comprehensive Analysis of Arguments for and against the Existence of God

The question of God's existence has been a central concern of human thought, spanning millennia of philosophical inquiry, theological debate, and scientific discovery. This report provides a comprehensive deep-dive into the major arguments for and against the existence of God, analyzing both historical and contemporary positions. It examines the logical structures, key proponents, and significant critiques of cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological arguments from theism, as well as the powerful counter-arguments centered on evil, hiddenness, and logical incoherence from atheism. By synthesizing these diverse perspectives, this analysis aims to illuminate the profound intellectual challenges and unresolved tensions that define one of humanity's most enduring questions.

## Theistic Arguments for God's Existence: Cosmological and Teleological Foundations

Theistic arguments for the existence of God are primarily grounded in empirical observations of the world and logical deductions about its ultimate origins and structure. These arguments seek to establish a necessary precondition for reality itself, moving from effects—such as the universe's beginning or its apparent design—to a cause or designer of immense power and intelligence. The two most prominent families of such arguments are the cosmological and the teleological, each with deep historical roots and modern iterations that continue to shape philosophical discourse.

The cosmological argument, which derives its name from the Greek word for "world" or "universe," posits that everything that exists has a cause, and since the universe exists, it too must have a cause. William Lane Craig presents a contemporary formulation of this argument based on the Big Bang theory, stating that whatever begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exist, therefore it has a cause [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. He identifies this cause as a timeless, immaterial, personal Creator [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. This version builds upon historical foundations laid by thinkers like Aristotle, Avicenna, and St. Thomas Aquinas, who argued for a First Cause or Unmoved Mover to explain the existence of change and motion in the world [[7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/)]. However, the argument is not without its critics. David Hume and Bertrand Russell raised objections to the principle of sufficient reason underlying the argument, questioning why the universe itself could not be uncaused or eternal [[7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/), [22](https://christian-apologist.com/2017/04/13/a-christians-rebuttal-to-why-i-am-not-a-christian-by-bertrand-russell/)]. Russell, for instance, suggested that the universe might simply exist without a cause, a view supported by John Stuart Mill [[24](http://www.markrkelly.com/Blog/2017/09/14/bertrand-russell-why-i-am-not-a-christian-summary-and-comments/), [25](https://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/whynot.html)]. Furthermore, some scientific theories propose alternative explanations. Peter Atkins, for example, argues that the universe could arise from nothing via acausal processes, citing its zero net energy and charge as evidence that no creator was needed [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)].

Parallel to the cosmological argument is the teleological argument, also known as the argument from design. This argument infers the existence of an intelligent designer from the observed complexity, order, and fine-tuning of the universe. William Lane Craig champions this position, asserting that the life-permitting initial conditions of the universe are so improbable that design is the best explanation [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. This line of reasoning finds support in the work of figures like Fred Hoyle and Robert Jastrow, who marveled at the delicate balance of physical constants required for life [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. The classic formulation of this argument is William Paley's watchmaker analogy, which suggests that just as finding a watch implies a watchmaker due to its intricate parts working together for a purpose, the complexity of nature implies a divine designer [[7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/)]. However, the teleological argument faces a formidable challenge from Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Bertrand Russell, in his 1927 lecture, invoked evolution to argue that adaptation results from organisms fitting their environment rather than the other way around, thus explaining complexity without a designer [[24](http://www.markrkelly.com/Blog/2017/09/14/bertrand-russell-why-i-am-not-a-christian-summary-and-comments/), [25](https://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/whynot.html)]. Skeptics also point to the world's imperfections, such as the Ku Klux Klan and Fascists, as evidence that if there is a designer, He is flawed or malevolent [[21](https://www.quora.com/What-points-about-Christianity-made-by-Bertrand-Russell-do-you-agree-with-and-what-points-do-you-disagree-with), [22](https://christian-apologist.com/2017/04/13/a-christians-rebuttal-to-why-i-am-not-a-christian-by-bertrand-russell/)]. While the argument is challenged, modern science continues to uncover new layers of cosmic fine-tuning, with discoveries like the ENCODE project (2012) suggesting more functionality in DNA than previously understood, which some interpret as supporting a design hypothesis [[22](https://christian-apologist.com/2017/04/13/a-christians-rebuttal-to-why-i-am-not-a-christian-by-bertrand-russell/)].

In summary, the cosmological and teleological arguments provide robust frameworks for arguing from the observable features of the universe to the existence of a supreme being. They appeal to fundamental intuitions about causality and purpose. However, they are constantly tested by scientific progress and philosophical scrutiny, particularly concerning the nature of the proposed cause or designer and whether alternative explanations can account for the same phenomena. The dialogue between these arguments and their critics remains a vital part of the ongoing search for understanding about the origins and nature of reality.

## The Moral Argument and Personal Experience: Grounding Faith in Objective Value and Intuitive Knowledge

Beyond arguments drawn from the physical universe, theism offers compelling reasons for belief rooted in ethics and subjective experience. The moral argument and appeals to immediate, personal knowledge of God provide avenues for grounding faith in what many believers consider to be objective facts about morality and direct, experiential reality. These arguments aim to show that certain features of our ethical consciousness and inner lives are best explained by the existence of a divine source.

The moral argument for God's existence contends that objective moral values and duties cannot exist without a transcendent foundation. William Lane Craig formulates this argument as a logically valid modus tollens inference: If God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist; objective moral values do exist; therefore, God exists [[33](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/the-moral-argument-for-god)]. This argument distinguishes between moral values, which are rooted in God's holy, loving, and just nature, and moral duties, which are expressed through His commands [[33](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/the-moral-argument-for-god)]. According to this view, God is not arbitrarily creating morality; rather, He is the paradigm of moral value, and His commands flow from His unchanging character [[33](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/the-moral-argument-for-god)]. This contrasts with secular ethical systems where morality might be seen as a mere social convention or evolved instinct, vulnerable to cultural relativism. Critics of this argument, however, often turn to the Euthyphro dilemma, famously posed by Plato and used by Bertrand Russell. The dilemma asks whether something is good because God wills it, or does God will it because it is good? If the former, morality becomes arbitrary; if the latter, then morality exists independently of God, thereby undermining the argument's premise that God is its sole foundation [[19](https://www.equip.org/articles/bertrand-russell-an-atheist-philosopher-christians-should-know/), [21](https://www.quora.com/What-points-about-Christianity-made-by-Bertrand-Russell-do-you-agree-with-and-what-points-do-you-disagree-with), [22](https://christian-apologist.com/2017/04/13/a-christians-rebuttal-to-why-i-am-not-a-christian-by-bertrand-russell/)]. Defenders like Craig argue that this dilemma can be resolved by grounding morality in God's unchanging character, but the debate over the source of objectivity remains a central point of contention [[33](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/the-moral-argument-for-god)].

Another avenue for theistic belief is through immediate, personal experience of God. William Lane Craig includes this as a fifth argument, suggesting that one can know God exists through a direct, non-inferential experience [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. This approach sidesteps the need for complex logical proofs by appealing to a different mode of knowing—one based on intuition, feeling, and personal encounter. This resonates with the views of philosophers like Søren Kierkegaard, who argued that existential truths of faith cannot be fully captured by rational demonstration [[10](https://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/anselm.shtml)]. For believers, religious experiences, such as feelings of divine presence, answered prayers, or mystical encounters, serve as powerful evidence. However, this form of justification is highly vulnerable to skepticism. From an atheist perspective, such experiences can be dismissed as self-delusion, hallucinations, neurological phenomena, or products of psychological suggestion [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. Peter Atkins, for example, explicitly labels religious experience as self-delusion [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. The very subjectivity of these experiences makes them difficult to verify or falsify, placing them outside the realm of public, shared evidence. This creates a significant epistemological divide, where what is for one person the most compelling proof of all is for another a sign of cognitive bias or mental illness. The challenge for the proponent of the argument from personal experience is to provide a framework for distinguishing genuine divine encounters from other types of psychological events, a task that remains philosophically fraught.

Together, the moral argument and the argument from personal experience represent attempts to ground belief in domains beyond the purely physical. They tap into universal human concerns with right and wrong and the profound sense of meaning and connection that many people feel. While they may lack the formal deductive structure of cosmological arguments, they offer a powerful and deeply personal case for theism. Yet, they face formidable challenges from philosophical dilemmas like the Euthyphro problem and the inherent unreliability of subjective testimony as a basis for universal truth claims.

## The Ontological Argument: A Priori Proof and Its Enduring Logical Flaws

Among the most intriguing and debated arguments for God's existence is the ontological argument, a unique proposition that seeks to prove God's existence through pure logic and definition alone, without recourse to empirical observation. First articulated by St. Anselm of Canterbury in the 11th century, this argument has provoked centuries of intense philosophical scrutiny, defending it against persistent and powerful criticisms. Its core ambition—to derive existence from concept—is simultaneously its greatest strength and its most glaring weakness.

St. Anselm's original formulation, presented in his work *Proslogion*, defines God as "a being than which nothing greater can be conceived" [[9](https://iep.utm.edu/anselm-ontological-argument/), [15](https://philarchive.org/archive/OPPAAT-2), [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument)]. Anselm then reasons that if such a being existed only in the mind, one could conceive of a greater being—one that exists in reality as well. Since by definition God is the greatest conceivable being, He must therefore exist in reality; otherwise, He would not be the greatest conceivable being, leading to a contradiction [[11](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2023/12/anselms-ontological-argument-guide-for.html), [13](https://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/pucourse/phi203/ontological.html)]. This argument employs a reductio ad absurdum: it assumes the opposite of what it wants to prove (that God exists only in the understanding) and shows that this assumption leads to a logical impossibility [[13](https://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/pucourse/phi203/ontological.html)]. Over time, the argument has been reformulated and defended by numerous thinkers. René Descartes offered a similar version, arguing that existence is a perfection and thus a supremely perfect being (God) must exist [[16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument)]. Later, Alvin Plantinga developed a modal version using the concept of "possible worlds," arguing that if it is even possible that a maximally great being (one with omnipotence, omniscience, and moral perfection in every possible world) exists, then such a being must exist in all worlds, including our own [[12](https://www.theparkwaychurch.com/blog/anselm-unicorns-and-the-ontological-argument), [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument)].

Despite its sophisticated refinements, the ontological argument is widely considered to be fallacious. The most famous and influential critique comes from Immanuel Kant, who argued that "existence is not a predicate" or a real property that can be added to a concept [[7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/), [9](https://iep.utm.edu/anselm-ontological-argument/), [10](https://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/anselm.shtml)]. According to Kant, when we list the attributes of a hundred-pound weight, we describe its properties (e.g., color, material), but saying it "exists" does not add another property to the list. Applying this to Anselm's argument, Kant contended that "existence in reality" is not a "great-making" property superior to "existence in the understanding." It does not make the concept of a thing greater; it merely asserts that the concept corresponds to something in the world. Therefore, the second premise of Anselm's argument—that existence in reality is greater than existence in the mind alone—is false, and the entire argument collapses [[10](https://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/anselm.shtml), [17](https://oxfordphilsoc.org/Documents/TalbotPrize/2015_M1.pdf)].

This criticism is reinforced by other objections. Gaunilo of Marmoutiers, a contemporary of Anselm, offered a devastating parody by applying the same logic to a "perfect island" [[10](https://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/anselm.shtml), [11](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2023/12/anselms-ontological-argument-guide-for.html)]. If the argument worked for God, he reasoned, it would also prove the existence of a perfect island, which is absurd [[17](https://oxfordphilsoc.org/Documents/TalbotPrize/2015_M1.pdf)]. Defenders of the ontological argument respond that the concept of God is unique in being a necessary being, unlike a contingent island, whose greatness can always be increased [[11](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2023/12/anselms-ontological-argument-guide-for.html)]. However, this response itself presupposes a controversial metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent beings. Other critics, like Norman Malcolm and Charles Hartshorne, have argued that if God's non-existence is logically impossible, then His existence is necessary [[9](https://iep.utm.edu/anselm-ontological-argument/)]. But this moves from possibility to necessity without adequately addressing the core issue of whether the concept of a maximally great being is coherent in the first place, a point raised by C. D. Broad and others [[16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument)]. Formal analyses by logicians like Paul Oppenheimer and Edward Zalta have attempted to salvage the argument by carefully distinguishing between different notions of "being" and "existence," but even they acknowledge that the argument relies on assumptions that can be contested [[14](https://mally.stanford.edu/ontological.pdf)]. Ultimately, the consensus among scholars is that while the ontological argument represents a remarkable attempt to prove God's existence through reason alone, its reliance on a questionable premise about existence as a predicate renders it unsound [[15](https://philarchive.org/archive/OPPAAT-2), [17](https://oxfordphilsoc.org/Documents/TalbotPrize/2015_M1.pdf)].

## The Problem of Evil: A Central Challenge to Theistic Coherence

The problem of evil is arguably the most powerful and enduring argument against the existence of the Abrahamic God—an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent (all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good) being. The core of the argument is a logical tension: how can such a God coexist with the vast amount and intensity of evil and suffering present in the world? If God is willing to prevent evil but cannot, He is impotent and not omnipotent. If He can prevent it but is unwilling, He is malevolent and not omnibenevolent. If He is both able and willing, then whence cometh evil? This ancient argument, attributed to Epicurus, has been advanced by countless thinkers and remains a primary battleground in the philosophy of religion [[6](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/1161/which-philosophers-have-argued-that-a-god-cannot-exist), [7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/)].

The argument is often framed probabilistically. Philosopher Paul Draper has argued that the high prevalence of nonbelief, especially given the global distribution of theism, is highly unlikely under evangelical Christianity, where God supposedly desires universal belief for salvation [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/), [7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/)]. Similarly, Gary Whittenberger, a clinical psychologist, mounts a powerful evidential argument based on the Holocaust. He structures his argument as a modus tollens: if an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly moral God exists, He would have prevented the Holocaust; the Holocaust occurred; therefore, God does not exist [[4](https://secularhumanism.org/2025/09/we-know-that-god-does-not-exist/)]. Whittenberger rejects responses like the free will defense, arguing that an all-powerful God could have designed humans to have free will without the capacity for genocide [[4](https://secularhumanism.org/2025/09/we-know-that-god-does-not-exist/)]. He further describes modern theistic responses to the Holocaust as a form of Holocaust denialism and labels the idea of "divine exceptionalism"—that God is above moral codes—as irrational special pleading [[4](https://secularhumanism.org/2025/09/we-know-that-god-does-not-exist/), [27](https://secularhumanism.org/authors/gary-whittenberger/)]. For Whittenberger, the Holocaust serves as a definitive, brutal counterexample to the existence of the omniGod [[27](https://secularhumanism.org/authors/gary-whittenberger/)].

Theists have developed a variety of responses, collectively known as theodicies, to address this formidable challenge. One of the most famous is the free will defense, championed by Alvin Plantinga. This defense distinguishes between logical and evidential problems of evil. It argues that moral evil (evil resulting from human actions) can be justified by the greater good of libertarian free will, which allows for genuine love and virtue [[3](https://press.rebus.community/intro-to-phil-of-religion/chapter/reasons-not-to-believe/)]. However, this defense is often criticized for failing to account for natural evils, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and diseases, which are not caused by human choices [[3](https://press.rebus.community/intro-to-phil-of-religion/chapter/reasons-not-to-believe/)]. Another major theodicy is John Hick's "soul-making" theodicy, which posits that suffering is a necessary part of a process that helps individuals develop virtues like courage, compassion, and resilience, thereby "making" their souls [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/), [7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/)]. Other proposed solutions include the idea that evil increases longing for God (Coakley 2016, Lehe 2004), provides a basis for hope (Cobb 2017), or that faith requires uncertainty (Dumsday 2015) [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)].

While these defenses offer potential explanations, they are not universally accepted. Critics like J.L. Mackie have argued that the existence of any gratuitous evil—a suffering event that does not contribute to a greater good—is incompatible with an all-powerful, all-good God [[3](https://press.rebus.community/intro-to-phil-of-religion/chapter/reasons-not-to-believe/)]. The sheer scale of suffering, from natural disasters to genocides, seems to many to defy easy explanation. Some atheists, like Michael Shermer, have pointed out that the extinction of 99.8% of all species that ever lived is strong evidence against a benevolent creator [[29](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-alleged-proof-that-Gary-Whittenberger-claims-to-have-in-regards-to-the-nonexistence-of-God)]. Furthermore, the moral character of a deity who allows such suffering is questioned. Bertrand Russell, for example, found Jesus' belief in eternal punishment in hell to be cruel and inconsistent with superlative wisdom or goodness, making Him an inadequate moral role model [[21](https://www.quora.com/What-points-about-Christianity-made-by-Bertrand-Russell-do-you-agree-with-and-what-points-do-you-disagree-with), [24](http://www.markrkelly.com/Blog/2017/09/14/bertrand-russell-why-i-am-not-a-christian-summary-and-comments/)]. In conclusion, the problem of evil poses a profound and multifaceted challenge to the coherence of theism. While theists have developed sophisticated theodicies, the persistence of seemingly pointless suffering continues to fuel powerful arguments for atheism, forcing a continual re-evaluation of the nature and existence of God in light of the world's undeniable pain.

## Divine Hiddenness and the Limits of Human Comprehension

Two closely related arguments challenge theism by focusing not on the external world but on the internal state of human belief and the very nature of God. The argument from divine hiddenness contends that if a personal, perfectly loving God existed, His presence would be evident enough to prevent widespread nonbelief. Simultaneously, the argument from divine incomprehensibility asserts that the God of classical theism is so radically "other" that He lies beyond the scope of human reason and language, rendering any positive claim about His existence meaningless. Together, these arguments target the very intelligibility of theistic belief.

The argument from divine hiddenness, notably formulated by philosopher J.L. Schellenberg, presents a deductive case. He defines "nonresistant nonbelief" as the state of an individual who lacks belief in God yet is not intentionally resisting God's influence or desire for a relationship with them [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. Schellenberg argues that if a perfectly loving God existed, such nonresistant nonbelievers would not exist, because a loving parent would ensure their children knew of their love. Since nonresistant nonbelief clearly exists, Schellenberg concludes that the omniGod of classical theism does not exist [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/), [3](https://press.rebus.community/intro-to-phil-of-religion/chapter/reasons-not-to-believe/)]. This argument has been extended by others. Theodore Drange notes the high global prevalence of nonbelief is unlikely under theism, where God supposedly desires universal salvation [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. Stephen Maitzen points to the uneven geographic distribution of theism as unexpected under a loving God [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. Jason Marsh introduces the concept of "natural nonbelief," arguing that prehistoric humans lacked even basic theistic concepts, which is more likely under naturalism than theism [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)].

Theists have offered several responses to this challenge. One strategy is to deny that nonresistant nonbelief actually exists, a view held by some who argue that all unbelief involves some element of resistance [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. Another approach is to redefine the relationship, suggesting that a personal relationship with God doesn't require propositional belief at all, but rather a different kind of awareness or orientation [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. A third, and perhaps most common, set of responses appeals to "greater goods" that justify God's hiddenness. These include the value of free will, soul-making, increased longing for God, or the importance of faith requiring uncertainty [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. Others propose that God's hiddenness prevents negative outcomes like coercion or resentment [[1](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/)]. However, critics find these responses unsatisfactory. They argue that a truly loving God could achieve these goods without leaving the evidence so sparse and ambiguous as to lead to widespread doubt and despair.

This leads directly to the argument from divine incomprehensibility. Thinkers like Thomas Aquinas described God as "totalliter aliter," or "totally other," meaning He is completely distinct from and beyond full human comprehension [[8](https://www.facebook.com/groups/165563067224915/posts/2072808426500360/)]. This perspective holds that God, as a pure perfect intelligence and the ground of all being, cannot be subjected to empirical analysis or exhausted by human concepts [[8](https://www.facebook.com/groups/165563067224915/posts/2072808426500360/)]. From this viewpoint, attempting to use human reason to prove or disprove God's existence is a category mistake. As Christofer Stankevich Ulyanov argues, it is a form of "scientific-reliant atheism" that commits a "blind faith" by assuming reason is the final arbiter of all truth, when in fact God is beyond its grasp [[8](https://www.facebook.com/groups/165563067224915/posts/2072808426500360/)]. This position effectively removes the God hypothesis from the domain of rational debate, viewing arguments for and against God as misguided attempts to cage an ineffable reality. This stance stands in stark contrast to the apologetic projects of figures like William Lane Craig, who rely heavily on logical arguments within a rationalist framework [[5](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/debates/what-is-the-evidence-for-against-the-existence-of-god/)]. The tension here is profound: one side insists on the primacy of reason to engage with the divine, while the other insists that reason is fundamentally incapable of reaching the divine. This schism highlights a foundational disagreement about the very nature of knowledge and the limits of human intellect in the quest for understanding the ultimate reality.

## Critiques of Atheism: The Burden of Proof and the Nature of Evidence

While the previous sections have focused on arguments *for* God, it is equally important to examine the philosophical stances of atheism, particularly the critiques leveled against them. Atheists employ a range of arguments, from logical inconsistencies to the lack of empirical evidence, but their positions themselves are subject to rigorous philosophical examination. Key debates center on the burden of proof, the adequacy of evidence, and the logical soundness of specific anti-theistic arguments.

One of the most contentious issues is the burden of proof. Bertrand Russell famously illustrated this with his teapot analogy: just as he could not prove that a tiny teapot does not orbit the sun between Earth and Mars, he argued that theists could not prove that God does exist [[7](https://bigthink.com/thinking/arguments-on-gods-existence/), [21](https://www.quora.com/What-points-about-Christianity-made-by-Bertrand-Russell-do-you-agree-with-and-what-points-do-you-disagree-with)]. Russell maintained that the burden of proof lies with the claimant—the theist—and that it is irrational to believe a claim simply because it cannot be disproven [[21](https://www.quora.com/What-points-about-Christianity-made-by-Bertrand-Russell-do-you-agree-with-and-what-points-do-you-disagree-with)]. Many modern atheists adopt a similar stance, arguing that they are not making a positive assertion of God's non-existence but are instead responding to specific theistic claims and pointing out their failings [[2](https://boxingpythagoras.com/2014/08/11/an-atheist-answers-20-short-arguments-against-gods-existence/)]. This position, sometimes called "weak atheism," posits a default assumption of no God until evidence proves otherwise, aligning with principles like Popperian falsificationism [[6](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/1161/which-philosophers-have-argued-that-a-god-cannot-exist)]. However, this raises the question of what constitutes sufficient evidence. Some, like Gary Whittenberger, claim to hold a "gnostic atheist" position, asserting that he knows God does not exist "beyond a reasonable doubt," a standard of proof more typical of legal contexts than metaphysical ones [[4](https://secularhumanism.org/2025/09/we-know-that-god-does-not-exist/)].

Critics of atheism, however, argue that this position is itself a dogmatic commitment that requires faith. Christofer Stankevich Ulyanov, for example, labels scientific-reliant atheism as a "blind faith" stance, akin to religious dogma [[8](https://www.facebook.com/groups/165563067224915/posts/2072808426500360/)]. They contend that denying the existence of God is a substantive claim that should be subject to the same standards of evidence as any other. Furthermore, some argue that conflating specific religious doctrines with general theism is a logical error [[2](https://boxingpythagoras.com/2014/08/11/an-atheist-answers-20-short-arguments-against-gods-existence/)]. For instance, critiquing biblical literalism is not the same as refuting the existence of a deistic God. This conflation, as seen in Hemant Mehta's video "20 Short Arguments Against God’s Existence," is identified as a rhetorical fallacy [[2](https://boxingpythagoras.com/2014/08/11/an-atheist-answers-20-short-arguments-against-gods-existence/)].

The specific arguments against God's existence are also subject to critique. The argument from evil, while powerful, is challenged on the grounds that theists can offer plausible, though not necessarily convincing, theodicies. The argument from divine hiddenness is countered with various proposals for "greater goods." The ontological argument is undermined by Kant's critique of existence as a predicate. Even the positivist argument from verification, which claims the concept of God is meaningless because it cannot be empirically verified, is problematic. As Bertrand Russell himself noted, the correspondence theory of truth states that beliefs are true only if they correspond to external facts, not internal conviction, implying that truth claims must be tied to reality in some way [[19](https://www.equip.org/articles/bertrand-russell-an-atheist-philosopher-christians-should-know/)]. To dismiss God as meaningless without engaging with the nuanced arguments for His existence is seen by some as intellectually lazy. Ultimately, the debate reveals a deep chasm in epistemology. The atheist seeks evidence and logical consistency as the basis for belief, while the theist may appeal to different forms of evidence, such as personal experience or the explanatory power of theism for morality and consciousness. The critiques highlight that neither side has a monopoly on logical rigor, and the resolution of this age-old debate depends on one's fundamental starting points regarding reason, evidence, and the nature of reality itself.
